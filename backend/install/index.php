<h1>Install Sassenach CMS</h1>

<p>Thank you for choosing <a href="http://www.sassenach-cms.org">Sassenach CMS</a>. You will now be taken through a (hopefully!) simple process in order to set up your Sassenach CMS install, configure it and then delete the installation directory.</p>

<p>Please note, it is vital that you ensure the installation directory has been removed once the installation is complete, as running the installation process again may result in destroying your set-up. You have been warned!</p>
